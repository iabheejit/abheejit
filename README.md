Know me. 


my work is multifarious in nature spanning inclusive innovation, space research and entrepreneurship. The words that define my persona are - Dreamer. Innovator. Orator. Traveler. Poet. Batman. 
​
After exploring several roles in the past decade, I found my passion to work on inclusive projects that use technology to improve lives. I ran two EdTech Startups, served as a fellow for Clean India Mission, built a regional startup community of over 5000 people. Tying everything together, in 2018, with my mentors I formed the Vruksh Ecosystem Foundation, a non-profit focussed towards building a culture of innovation, problem-solving, and entrepreneurship in underserved geographies to solve local problems and #BuildTheFuture. 
​
The pandemic exposed the problem of inaccessible education for several rural children. My team & I are currently building a text & audio-based learning tool to address this digital divide and help children learn.
​
Reach out if you want to talk about technology, business, space or even comic books. I keep getting invited to deliver talks and conduct training; call me if you feel I can add value somewhere!
 
If I can't be of service, I may know others who can meet your needs. I believe in creating and fostering relationships - and giving back - keeping the head high and the feet grounded.
